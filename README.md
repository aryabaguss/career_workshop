# Technical Test Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to various technical coding challenges and practice problems from Pacmann Technical Python Test. It serves as a documentation of my learning journey and coding practice.

## Structure
The repository is organized by different types of problems/challenges:
- List Manipulation
- String Operations
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Logical Thinking

## Technologies Used
- Python

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/aryabaguss/career_workshop```

2. Navigate to specific problem folders to view solutions

3. Each solution includes:
   - Problem statement
   - Solution code
   - Test cases (if applicable)

## Problem Examples
Here are some examples of the problems solved:
1. Count multiples in range
2. Finding majority elements in a list
3. Check for unique digits
4. Move zero values to end in a list
5. Anagrams
6. Find longest consecutive sequence in a list
7. Find column names with Null values
8. Count users from spesific provinces
9. Swap adjacent pairs in a list
10. Multiply consecutive airs in a sorted list


## Learning Outcomes
Through these technical tests, I've practiced and improved:
- Problem-solving skills
- Code optimization
- Time complexity analysis
- Clean code principles
